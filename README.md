iOS-SampleApp
=============

Here's a sample iOS App in Objective-C for Xcode 5 and the SDK 7.
It is compatible with iOS5, iOS6 and iOS7 and was optimized for both iPhone and iPad.

It features Storyboard, UITableViewController with custom UITableViewCell, NSFetchedResultsController, UISearchDisplayController, MapKit and CoreData.

But this sample can be improved as it has a basic Web Service implementation, is still based on MRC memory model and Use Thread Confinement to Support Concurrency with CoreData instead of a Parent Context.

Note that the Crashlytics Build Phase script has been commented out and you should include your own Key if you plan to enable it.
